# Heroku App - Happiness Data
This app uses SQLite for data storage
Python app.py for data retrieval and JSON webservice calls
JavaScripts for reading the JSONs from Python Flask Routes and displaying all the bar charts with all functions for interfacing with Python source code and HTML content code
HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for pay layout and content
Source data is taken from Kaggle from a CSV file. We used Python Pandas (dataframes) and Pythong SQLAlchemy to read csv and store the data subsequently into SQLite
